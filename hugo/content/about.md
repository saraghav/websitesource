I graduated with my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in December 2016.

For my Master's research, I worked with Prof. Suman Banerjee, as part of the Wireless NetworkinG Systems (WiNGS Lab), on privacy in mobile sensing, wireless spectrum analysis and perception for home automation applications. One of the projects I worked on as part of the lab is now a startup (Emonix H2O), under the leadership of Neil Klingensmith. I have also worked with Prof. T. M. Jahns from the Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC) on controller design for Hybrid Energy Storage Systems; specifically, Battery/Ultracapacitor systems.

Before Madison, I worked at Texas Instruments Inc. for two years with the Device Reliability Group. I completed my undergraduate degree at the National Institute of Technology, Trichy, in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
